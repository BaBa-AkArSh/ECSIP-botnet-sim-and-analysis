# 🕷️ Modular Botnet Simulation

This project simulates a custom botnet in a secure VirtualBox lab using a Python-based C2 server and modular bots for Linux and Windows.

> ⚠️ For educational use only — tested in isolated environments.

---

## 🔧 Features

- Flask-based C2 dashboard
- Python bots (Linux + Windows)
- Modules: Keylogger, Port Scanner, DDoS
- HTTP polling + result reporting
- Wireshark-based traffic analysis

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python, Flask, SQLite
- VirtualBox (Host-only)
- Wireshark

---

## ▶️ Quick Start

1. Start the C2 server:
   ```bash
   cd c2_dashboard
   python3 app.py
````

2. Run bot client:

   ```bash
   cd bots/linux_bot
   python3 main.py
   ```

3. Use the dashboard to send tasks & view output.

## 📁 Structure

* `bots/` – Linux & Windows bots
* `c2_dashboard/` – Web-based control panel
* `target_server/` – Flask server for DDoS testing
* `analysis/` – Wireshark logs, screenshots

---

## 📌 Note

All testing was done in a fully offline, virtual lab for research and learning purposes.
